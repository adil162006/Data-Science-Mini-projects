# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the tragic voyage.

## 📊 Analysis Includes
- Overall survival rate analysis
- Gender-based survival patterns
- Class-based survival rates
- Age distribution analysis
- Impact of fare on survival
- Port of embarkation influence
- Children vs adults survival rates

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations

## 📋 Key Findings
1. Gender played a crucial role in survival (women had higher survival rates)
2. Higher class passengers (1st class) had better survival chances
3. Children under 16 had higher survival rates than adults
4. Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival rates
5. Port of embarkation showed some correlation with survival

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Project.ipynb
```

## 📁 Dataset
The analysis uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, containing information about:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of Embarkation (Embarked)
- Survival status

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:
- Bar plots for survival rates
- Box plots for age and fare distribution
- Violin plots for age distribution across classes
- Distribution plots for various features
